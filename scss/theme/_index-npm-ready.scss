// This file should be updated when using the base package as an npm dependency
// Replace the relative imports with the actual npm package imports

// When base becomes an npm package, update these imports:
// @forward "@your-org/base-scss/variables";
// @forward "@your-org/base-scss/mixins"; 
// @forward "@your-org/base-scss/functions";

// For now, using relative imports during development:
@forward "../base/variables";
@forward "../base/mixins";
@forward "../base/functions";

// Always import your local overrides last
@use './overrides';
